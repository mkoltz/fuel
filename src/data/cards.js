    "description":"Pourover coffee starts with (freshly) ground coffee, a filter, and a filter holder, often called a 'pourover dripper.' At the most basic level, pourover brewing involves pouring water over and through the grounds to extract the coffee flavors into your cup or serving vessel."

    "description":"Kalita Wave brings a classic and dynamic brewing technique to the pour over method. The dripper features a flat-bottomed brew bed for even extraction, and a filter design that reduces contact between the brewing space and the dripper itself. Used by top specialty coffee bars around the world and in professional coffee making competitions, the Kalita Wave allows you to brew your favorite coffee more evenly, which directly contributes to fuller flavor and a more balanced extraction."

    "description":"The v60 pour over has recently risen in popularity. Roasters and coffee connoisseurs favour this brewing method for the clean, round and complex layers of flavour that are extracted from the beans. But let’s be honest, we’ve fallen in love with the pour over because it’s cool, inexpensive and Japanese."

    "description":"The Chemex brews coffee using the infusion method, which makes it most similar to drip coffee in terms of body and taste. Chemex filters are 20-30% thicker than those used by other pourover methods such as the Hario. The result is a slower brew and a richer cup of coffee. Although not as rich as the French Press, the Chemex does produce a sediment free cup of coffee that will impress anyone used to the weaker taste of most auto-drip coffee machines.",

Coffee is steeped for 10–50 seconds (depending on grind and preferred strength) and then forced through a filter by pressing the plunger through the tube. The filters used are either the AeroPress paper filters or disc shaped thin metal filters.  The maker describes the result as an espresso strength concentration of coffee, but its most frequent use is more in the filter brew strength.",

Washed coffee’s are de-pulped then fermented to promote the separation of any remaining tissues from the bean and parchment, then washed clean prior to drying. <br><br> Naturals tend to have more fruity flavors because the bean has more time to interact with the natural sugars from the cherry as enzymes break down the mucilage around the bean.

Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).<br><br> Drip coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press.",
